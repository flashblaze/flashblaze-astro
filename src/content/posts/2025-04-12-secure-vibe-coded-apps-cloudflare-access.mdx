# Background

I wanted to share some large video files with my friends on Discord, but due to the file size limit I could not. I could have easily uploaded them to YouTube (and make them unlisted) or my Google Drive (which would have eaten up my space), but where's the fun in that. Instead, I thought, why not upload them to my <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/" target="_blank">R2</a> bucket and then share that URL instead.

This being a fun little project, I thought why not also give <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383" target="_blank">"vibe coding"</a> a try. The project is open source on my <a href="https://github.com/flashblaze/files" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as well.

But now the issue was, the domain from which I was uploading the files was unauthenticated. Anyone could just visit the domain and begin uploading files to my R2 bucket which I did not want. Furthermore, having auth for such a simple side project seemed overkill to me.

# Cloudflare Access to the rescue

[Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) allows you to configure who can reach your application based on the policies you set. Automatic identification via GitHub OAuth worked the best for me since I'm always logged into GitHub from pretty much everywhere. Below steps will show you how to configure one for yourself.

# Confguration

## Creating a login method

1. Go to <a href="https://one.dash.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Cloudflare One</a>, click on **Settings** and then **Authentication**.

2. Under **Login methods** click on **Add new** and then click on **GitHub** on the next screen.

3. Follow the on screen instructions and put in the **App ID** and **Client
   Secret**.

## Creating a policy

Now that a login method has been created, we need to configure it a bit.

1. Under **Access**, click on **Policies** and then **Add an application**.
2. Enter **Policy name**, **Action** as **Allow** and **Session duration** to whatever you want. I personally like to set it to **24 hours**.

/>

3. Under **Selector** select **Login methods** and under **Value** choose the GitHub login method you created earlier.
4. Click on **+ Add include**, choose **Emails** under **Selector** and add the emails which you want to allow under the **Value** field.
5. Click on **Save**.

## Securing the application

1. Under **Access**, click on **Applications** and then **Add an application**.
2. Select **Self-hosted**.
3. Add an **Application name**. If your website is on a subdomain, enter it, else leave it blank and choose the **Domain** already added in your Cloudflare account.
4. Click on **Select existing policies** and choose the GitHub policy which you created earlier.

/>

5. Under **Login methods** disable **Accept all available identity providers**, select only the **GitHub** provider (in case you have multiple configured) and enable **Instant Auth** which would automatically trigger the GitHub OAuth flow.

/>

6. Click on **Next**, **Next** and **Save**.

Now if anyone visits your application, they would be allowed only if their GitHub email maches the one which you have specified. You have now successfully secured your "vibe coded" application.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a separate API, ensure you have something similar in place for that as well. I only needed to secure my single app since it was a fullstack application.
